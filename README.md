This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Redesigned Tinder as a web application and leveraging their existing REST API to allow users to swipe multiple matches at once. This is just a quick MVP demo and could easily build on top of it, such as changing user's location etc, messaging matches, statistics, etc.

This is the front end code. You'll need the back end java code to have this working 100%: https://github.com/ngukev/Tinder-Service

Steps to run the application:
  - Download the java application: https://github.com/ngukev/Tinder-Service
    - Run Application.java
  - Download this repo's code:https://github.com/ngukev/Tinder-Web
    - npm run install (download all the javascript dependencies) 
    - npm run start
  - Now the application should pop up in an internet browser on this endpoint: http://localhost:3000/
  - Login and go start mass swiping!
